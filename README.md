This is the initiated README for team coden't, Please edit this as you build your project
we have created an app that is going to predict the severity of the coronavirus in a patient by using their temperature , oxymeter reading , spirometer readingt and chest x ray image
if this app is placed and linked with all the hospitals throughout the country, we will have a very quick and efficient medical system in the country which is very much essential at this point of time in the pandemic
